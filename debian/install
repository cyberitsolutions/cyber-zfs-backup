## Trying to use "dh_systemd_enable --name eric" wasn't working.
## All the variants I tried failed in confusing ways,
## and the manpage didn't help me understand AT ALL.
##
## Further, we want to have .timer units, which dh_systemd_* doesn't
## support as at dh-systemd=1.33.
##
## Try creating the entire systemd config ourselves and hope
## dh_systemd_* pick up on it. --twb, May 2016 (#24019)
